sklearn.datasets.make_classification:
Generate a random n-class classification problem. This initially creates clusters of points normally distributed (std=1) about vertices of an n_informative-dimensional hypercube with sides of length 2*class_sep and assigns an equal number of clusters to each class. It introduces interdependence between these features and adds various types of further noise to the data.


matplotlib.colors.Colormap.ListedColormap:
Colormap object generated from a list of colors.This may be most useful when indexing directly into a colormap, but it can also be used to generate special colormaps for ordinary mapping.

sklearn.datasets.make_blobs:
Generate isotropic Gaussian blobs for clustering.

sklearn.datasets.make_regression:
Generate a random regression problem.The input set can either be well conditioned (by default) or have a low rank-fat tail singular profile.The output is generated by applying a (potentially biased) random linear regression model with n_informative nonzero regressors to the previously generated input and some gaussian centered noise with some adjustable scale.
